Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) 

A Python implementation of the Pelican Optimization Algorithm, a nature-inspired metaheuristic technique designed for solving complex optimization problems. This project explores its application in Artificial Intelligence, particularly for global optimization tasks.

---

Overview

The Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) is inspired by the unique hunting behavior of pelicans. By simulating the pelicans' strategies of exploration and exploitation in the search space, this algorithm efficiently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult computational problems.

This project demonstrates the implementation of POA in Python with applications in AI model tuning and benchmark function optimization.
